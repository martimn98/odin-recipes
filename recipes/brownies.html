    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The vegan brownies that tick all boxes: they're fudgy, gooey, cut easily and are easy to make!
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>4 tablespoons</b> ground flax</b></li>
        <li><b>125 ml</b> water</li>
        <li><b>115 g</b> vegan butter, melted</li>
        <li><b>200 g</b> granulated sugar</li>
        <li><b>220 g</b> brown sugar</li>
        <li><b>1 tablespoon</b> pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li><b>125 g</b> all purpose flour</li>
        <li><b>85 g</b> unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li><b>1/2 teaspoon</b> salt</li>
        <li><b>1 teaspoon</b> baking powder</li>
        <li><b>200 g</b> non-dairy chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the flax eggs by stirring the ground flax and water in a small bowl. Set aside to thicken. Preheat the oven to 180ÂºC and line a 7 x 11 pan with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Melt the vegan butter (earth balance brand preferred), and measure 1/2 cup. I do this by microwaving the vegan butter in a glass measuring cup, in 30 second intervals, until melted.
        </li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk the melted vegan butter and sugars together. Add the flax eggs and vanilla, whisk until evenly combined.
        </li>
        <li>Over the same large bowl, sift in the flour and cocoa powder. Add the salt and baking powder and stir with a large wooden spoon until just combined, do not over mix. 
        </li>
        <li>Fold in half of the chocolate chips. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and smooth out the top with a spoon or your hands. Sprinkle the rest of the chocolate chips on top of the batter.
        </li>
        <li>Bake for 35-40 minutes. The brownies may still be bubbling and not look done, but they will firm up a lot as they cool.
        </li>
        <li>Remove from the oven, allow to cool in the pan for 15 minutes, then pull the brownies out, using the parchment paper and let cool for another 15-30 minutes before slicing and serving.
        </li>
    </ol>
