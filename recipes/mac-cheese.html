    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Ready in 20min, this is a Mac and Cheese you won't forget!
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Raw cashews</b></li>
        <li><b>Water</b></li>
        <li><b>Fresh lemon juice</b></li>
        <li><b>Nutritiunal yeast</b></li>
        <li><b>Turmeric</b></li>
        <li><b>Garlic powder</b></li>
        <li><b>Salt</b></li>
        <li><b>Vegan cheese</b></li>
        <li><b>Elbow noodles</b></li>
        <li><b>Bread crumbs</b></li>
        <li><b>Vegan butter</b></li>
        <li><b>Smoked paprika</b></li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour boiling hot water over the cashews in a bowl or measuring dish. I usually heat water in my tea kettle or a small pot, then pour it over the nuts. Get your pasta cooking as well.</li>
        <li>Let the nuts soak for about 5 minutes. If you donâ€™t have a Vitamix, you may want to let them soak for an hour or even overnight so they will get smooth when you blend them. Drain the cashews and add them to a blender, along with the fresh water, lemon juice, nutritional yeast, turmeric, garlic powder, salt and vegan cheese if using.
        </li>
        <li>Blend until very, very smooth! This will take a few minutes, perhaps a little longer if you are using a regular blender.
        </li>
        <li>If making the baked version, mix the breadcrumbs, butter and paprika in a small bowl until crumbly.
        </li>
    </ol>
