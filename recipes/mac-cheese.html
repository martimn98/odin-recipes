    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Easy and cheesy and ready in 20min, this is a Mac and Cheese you won't forget!
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Raw cashews</b></li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>Nutritiunal yeast</li>
        <li>Turmeric</li>
        <li>Garlic powder</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Vegan cheese</li>
        <li>Elbow noodles</li>
        <li>Bread crumbs</li>
        <li>Vegan butter</li>
        <li>Smoked paprika</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Pour boiling hot water over the cashews in a bowl or measuring dish. I usually heat water in my tea kettle
            or a small pot, then pour it over the nuts. Get your pasta cooking as well.</li>
        <li>
            Let the nuts soak for about 5 minutes. If you donâ€™t have a Vitamix, you may want to let them soak for an
            hour or even overnight so they will get smooth when you blend them. Drain the cashews and add them to a
            blender, along with the fresh water, lemon juice, nutritional yeast, turmeric, garlic powder, salt and vegan
            cheese if using.</li>
        <li>
            Blend until very, very smooth! This will take a few minutes, perhaps a little longer if you are using a
            regular blender.</li>
        <li>
            If making the baked version, mix the breadcrumbs, butter and paprika in a small bowl until crumbly.</li>
        <li>
            Add the drained noodles to a casserole dish and pour in the cheese sauce. Stir so the noodles are coated.</li>
        <li>
            Sprinkle the breadcrumb topping over the top and bake for about 15 minutes. Do NOT over bake or it will dry
            out. I also broiled it just for a few minutes until the breadcrumbs turned a golden brown.</li>
    </ol>
