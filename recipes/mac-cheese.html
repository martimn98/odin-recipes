    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Easy and cheesy and ready in 20min, this is a Mac and Cheese you won't forget!
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>200g</b> raw cashews</b></li>
        <li><b>0.5 l</b> water</li>
        <li><b>3 tablespoons</b> fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li><b>22g</b> Nutritional yeast</li>
        <li><b>1/4 teaspoon</b> turmeric</li>
        <li><b>1/2 teaspoon</b> garlic powder</li>
        <li><b>1 1/2 teaspoons</b> salt</li>
        <li><b>1 bag</b> shredded vegan cheese</li>
        <li><b>350 g</b> elbow pasta</li>
        <li><b>90g</b> bread crumbs</li>
        <li><b>4 tablespoons</b> vegan butter, melted</li>
        <li><b>1/4 teaspoon</b> smoked paprika</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Pour boiling hot water over the cashews in a bowl or measuring dish. I usually heat water in my tea kettle
            or a small pot, then pour it over the nuts. Get your pasta cooking as well.</li>
        <li>
            Let the nuts soak for about 5 minutes. If you donâ€™t have a Vitamix, you may want to let them soak for an
            hour or even overnight so they will get smooth when you blend them. Drain the cashews and add them to a
            blender, along with the fresh water, lemon juice, nutritional yeast, turmeric, garlic powder, salt and vegan
            cheese if using.</li>
        <li>
            Blend until very, very smooth! This will take a few minutes, perhaps a little longer if you are using a
            regular blender.</li>
        <li>
            If making the baked version, mix the breadcrumbs, butter and paprika in a small bowl until crumbly.</li>
        <li>
            Add the drained noodles to a casserole dish and pour in the cheese sauce. Stir so the noodles are coated.</li>
        <li>
            Sprinkle the breadcrumb topping over the top and bake for about 15 minutes. Do NOT over bake or it will dry
            out. I also broiled it just for a few minutes until the breadcrumbs turned a golden brown.</li>
    </ol>
